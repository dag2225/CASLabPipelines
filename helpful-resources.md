# Helpful External Resources

- Bioconductor: includes a bunch of helpful [vignettes](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/package-vignettes/) that explain how to use different libraries hosted on their site.
- A quick start guide for using the DESeq2 package can be found on the [Bioconductor website here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#quick-start).
- An undergraduate student in the CAS Lab, Alex Chui, also has a site with important information on how DESeq2 can be used: [Alex's Github Site](https://alexchui252.github.io/BioinformaticsWorkflows/RNA-seq/deseq2.html)
